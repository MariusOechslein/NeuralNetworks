# Neural Networks Kaggle Competition
ANN course 1. semester at MAI THWS WÃ¼rzburg

# Goal 
In this competition, your task is to predict the start and end of human steps from a set of 6 signals. The data was recorded using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, which were held in the hand during 4 different activities, including simple walking, walking up and down stairs, and standing still.

# Rules
1) Learning algorithm
You can use any learning algorithm you think may work. However, you must implement it yourself using Python and/or standard PyTorch API (use of scikit-learn library is not allowed) and be able to explain it and argue for the reasons you chose it in the final report.

You shall implement, test and comment at least 3 fundamentally different algorithms! Fundamentally different algos does not mean just changing the hyperparameters (e.g. number of layers, hidden nodes, learning rate etc.). It really needs to be something else, e.g. different architecture, different pre-processing of the data, different loss, etc. There should be some logic to your choices, you should be able to argue WHY you picked the algorithm. "Randomly" is not a good answer.

Your own eyes are not a valid acceptable algorithm :) Do not label the test dataset manually :).

2) Submission limits
You can submit to the Kaggle platform at most 3 submissions per day. Think well before you submit to make sure you score reasonable well.

3) Submission rounds and evaluation

The evaluation of the portfolio will be based on your final report including the code (qulaity of presentation, quality of code, choice of methods) and the follow-up discussion (understanding your own work). In total, you can get 60 points from this Portfolio 3. (The remaining 40 points come from the smaller Portfolio exercies 1 and 2).

There will, however, be an opportunity to gain some bonus points from participating in the competition. These will be specified and announced as we go through E-learning. For example, they can be related to achieving better score than a baseline solution that we release.

4) Teams and collaboration

You shall work in teams of 4. Create your teams in Kaggle and submit all solutions under your specific team name.

You can discuss freely with your colleagues in the course ideas and strategies to attack the problem - exchange of knowledge and ideas is good! However, remember that the submissions shall be based on your own implementations and that you shall describe and argue in favour of your chosen approach in your own words in the final report. Hence, you shall only use approaches and tricks you fully comprehend and can explain and defend. This shall be your own work!

Be inventive, play fair and have fun.
